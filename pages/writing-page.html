                            <h2>Money Moves - Web Article</h2>
                            <p>This article was written as a concept article for an investing newsletter.</p>
                            <p class="content-article">I pose to you a question: <br><br> 

                                <em>Is it possible to earn a billion dollars?</em> <br><br> 
                                
                                The short answer? Not likely. <br><br> 
                                
                                Let's look at why:
                                The highest-paying job in the US as of 2019 is “Physician” at $193,000 per year. Let's be generous and round up to $200,000. 
                                Assuming that nothing changed, you would have to work as a doctor for <em>5000 years</em> in order to earn a billion dollars. <br><br> 
                                
                                Okay, what about corporate executives? They earn millions a year, right? 
                                Well, if we assume that they have a punch-clock job like anyone else, 
                                the average CEO earns just under $20 million per year. So let's call is 20 for easy math. 
                                That's <em>50 years</em> of working. Far more doable, especially if you start at, say, 18 years old. 
                                Retire at 68 having earned a billion dollars? Not bad. <br><br> 
                                
                                That sucks if you consider that the majority of CEOs don't get the job until their 50s; they'd be dead well before they earn that billion. <br><br> 
                                
                                So how do billionaires do it? Frankly, they don't <em>earn</em> anything. They <em>make</em> a billion dollars. 
                                And there is all the difference in the world. Those billionaire CEOs who get salary pay of $20 million? Odds are they aren't <em>just</em> CEOs. 
                                They are… wait for it… <em>business owners and investors</em>. <br><br> 
                                
                                But wait, what does that have to do with anything? <br><br> 
                                
                                Well, I'm sure you've seen this before: <br><br> 
                                
                                <img src="/media/images-cw-profile/ESBI.png" alt="" style="max-width: 50%;"> <br><br>
                                
                                If you haven't, those are Cashflow Quadrants, sometimes called ESBI. 
                                Popularized by Robert Kiyosaki, business mogul, real estate investor, CEO, and so on and so forth. <br> <br> 
                                
                                It's a simple diagram to show you how you can make money. 
                                This is through employment, self-employment, business ownership, and investment.<br> <br> 
                                
                                Everything on the left is active - you work for your money. 
                                If you don't go to work, you don't get paid. But, you have the security of a consistent income. 
                                Unless you are like many people, where even one job is not enough. <em>And</em> you'll never earn that billion.<br> <br> 
                                
                                Everything on the right is "passive" - your money works for you (at least, in theory). 
                                Your money or system will do the work so you don't have to. 
                                There's less security in the short-term, but there's freedom and long-term stability to be had. 
                                And that's the path to that billion.<br> <br> 
                                
                                Business owners and Investors utilize other people and money itself to make more. 
                                They earn <em>nothing</em>, but they make <em>everything</em>. <br> <br> 
                                
                                Most people don't actually want a billion dollars. 
                                But the idea here isn't that everyone should be super-rich. 
                                The philosophy behind getting to a billion dollars is the same as getting to a million, 
                                or hundred-thousand, or ten-thousand - you need to think creatively and create the systems that will make that money. <br> <br> 
                                
                                Even if it's a simple mindset change, you can gain greater financial security by 
                                recognizing the institutions and systems in place and how money is actually made and 
                                distributed. Armed with that knowledge, making that billion, or whatever your personal 
                                goal is, becomes that much closer to being realized. </p>

                                <strong>ABOUT ME</strong> <br><br>
                                I'm Sean Wade, owner of Pro-Active Investments LLC. 
                                I'm a real estate investor and mentor who specializes in multifamily properties. 
                                I'm all about finding the best deals and helping people find their best investments. <br><br>

                                Beyond my work, family is everything. Without family and loved ones, we are nothing. 
                                I believe that it's not about what you receive in life, but it's what you give and the impact you leave on people. <br><br>

                                <strong>EXPERIENCE</strong> <br><br>
                                I help people achieve real estate success by giving them the knowledge and tools to become as 
                                successful as they want to be, because I believe in empowering people so they can help others in turn. 
                                A lot of people in real estate want to be lone wolves, but a wolf is only as strong as its pack. 
                                I know what it's like to fail. I also know what it's like to succeed. I lost a quarter-million dollars on 
                                my first two deals because I didn't know what I was doing. Then I wised up, got educated, improved myself, 
                                and I haven't taken a loss since. I've made back that first loss many times over because I kept moving forward. 
                                I use my failures and successes in real estate to keep my pack, the most important people to me, safe and secure, 
                                and I share that experience so that others can do the same.<br><br>
